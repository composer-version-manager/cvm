# Composer Version Manager

[Composer 2](https://getcomposer.org/upgrade/UPGRADE-2.0.md) is here. It's time for a one stop shop for switching between major (and minor 
üë∂) composer versions.

> But wait, what about `composer self-update --1` and `--2`?

Well I'm glad you've asked!

There are some added benefits this CLI will bring to you:

1. Cached `composer.phar` for faster version toggling.
1. Per-directory automated and configurable context switching.
1. Production and pipeline friendly installation via [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/).
1. It's as simple as `cvm 1` and `cvm 2`.
